Crowd funding is a blockchain project which I developed with my friends to learn about solidity,
basics of blockchain and also about to learn about how I can use metamask and intergrate it with my 
it with my blockchain contract. 

There were several data points that we took care of extensively 
like there should be some minimum contribution below which contributtion was not acceptable , a deadline
to do donation before which donations had to be made for the specific project. 

There was also a criteria that manager of the contract/fund had to have majority in his  
favour before he could make withdrawl from the contract.

Then I wrote the code by which I was able to get fund from people that was connected to there meta mask wallet and they
had to meet the minimum amount criteria and deadline. 

After collection of the fund the manager request was validation and
if the amount that was requested was gathered then it was checked whether or not 50% of the donors where ready for the transfer of money
(in this case ethers), the transaction is made . If there is any field that is not met then the ether are transefered back to all the people.


Lottery System :

A fixed amount of money was collected from various users and and used a random function that to transfer to it to the user who was randomly chosen as the winner.
The minimum number of user had to be greater than 3 for the chosing the winner/
